instance: steak

attributes:
temperature = 145;
menuType = "dinner";
isServed = true;
tableNumber = 6;

methods:
The grill_entree method increased the temperature attribute.
The menuType attribute was modified by the close_menu method
by switching the menuType from "Lunch" to "Dinner".
We confirmed that the server has served the entree because
we checked the isServed attribute returned true after we
ran the serve_entree method.
We confirmed which table we needed to clean the entrees from
with clean_table method that referenced the tableNumber
attribute.
