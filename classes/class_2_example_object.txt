instance: bartender

attributes:
name = "John Smith";
isTrained = true;
wage = 5;
crewType = "close";

method:
The server was assigned a shift with the assign_shift method
which referenced the value "John Smith" of the name
attribute to assign the shift.
The verify_training method referenced the isTrained attribute
to determine that John Smith did indeed have enough training
to work by himself.
We paid John Smith his hourly bartender wage of $5 with the
initiate_compensation method and used the wage attribute
to pay John the correct amount.
We confirmed John was available to work by referencing the
crewType attribute with the confirm_availability method.
